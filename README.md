# kubernetes

      >>  Kubernetes is an open-source system that handles the work of scheduling containers onto a compute cluster and manages the workloads to ensure they run as the user intends.
      >>  Kubernetes is an open source container Management tool which automates container deployment, container (de) scaling and container load balancing.
      >>  it works in all cloud vendors: Public,Hybrid & on-premises

Containers do not waste or block host resources unlike virtual machines. Containers have isolated libraries and binaries specific to the application they are running.

* Kubernets is not a docker
*           Docker      -->   Containerization platform
*           Kubernetes  -->   Conatiner manageable platform
*           Docker swarm also doing the same container manageable platform but auto scaling ,load balancing concept are missing . Manual intervention are required.
*           Kubernetes is not for simplle application architecture and preferrably for complex application

* Kubernetes is actually for,
